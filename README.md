## üë®‚Äçüíª Live Version

Check out the website: [Good First Issue Finder](https://finder.eddiehub.io)

## üëá Prerequisites

Before installation, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. Fork the project [here](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/good-first-issue-finder/fork)
2. Clone the project
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/good-first-issue-finder.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory `cd good-first-issue-finder`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install`
5. If you encountered error like `engine not compatible with your version on node/npm`

   upgrade your node version from [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

   OR

   By following commands from [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-update-node-js-and-npm-to-next-version/)

   We highly recommend installing the current LTS version of node.

6. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Then add your GitHub Oauth values (see example in `.env.example` file)

> **Note:** You need to set up an Oauth App(not GitHub App) in Github to get the required values. See the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
> The Callback Url needs to point to the endpoint of the baseURL the app should run on: `http://localhost:5173/api/authentication/callback`. 
> Also, never commit the .env file, it is ignored by Git.

7. Run `npm run dev`

Alternatively, skip all the steps by using [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/good-first-issue-finder)

> **Note:** You still need to do the 6th step as defined earlier even if you are using Gitpod to run the app.

## üß™ Testing

We're using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for running End-To-End Tests.
For running the tests you would need to install the playwright dependencies by running

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```
